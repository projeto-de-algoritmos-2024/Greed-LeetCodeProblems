Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.

 

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
Example 3:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
 

Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 105
intervals[i].length == 2
-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104
